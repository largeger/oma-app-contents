# ðŸ“… 02.02.2023 revealjs: Using reveal-md for locally hosted presentations
I used the IDE integrated "one-click" hosting solution to present my reveal.js slide until then.
I learned: There is a tool (reveal-md)[https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md] which can be used to run the one-click solution from command line (which makes the useage independend from particular IDE features).
After installation I need the following command (run in the root-dir of my project) to start the presentation:
````
reveal-md . --separator "\n---slide---" --vertical-separator "\n---vert---" -w
````

# ðŸ“… 21.02.2023 revealjs: locating ressources relative - not absolute
When using reveal.js together with external ressources (images) in subfolders, it is strongly recommended to add these ressources with relative locations within your markdown files - absolute paths will lead to problems when using reveal-md, because reveal-md will start to look for the ressources in some probably different subfolder.
Example markdown:
````
![junit-setup1](images/junit-import1.png)
````
